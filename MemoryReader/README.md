# Linux-Demos
## About ##
Linux Demos is a project brought to you by TibiaPF
This is an open source project, currently unlicensed. As and when we see a need to license it, we will do so.

## Getting Started ##
To compile and run this project you don't need much. Install Qt Creator 4.0.3 with Qt Libraries version 5.7.0 and hit the terminal. Navigate to the directory and run Qmake Test.pro - once done, you'll have a Makefile, so just run make and you should now have a binary named ./Test.

## Future Plans ##
We will rename this project in the near future, but for the short term it will probably stagnate a bit. We've implemented a ReadInt method which should satisfy our current needs, but in the future I expect we'll add methods to read character arrays, and whole chunks of data at once.

## Pre-requesites ##
* Qt 5.7.0
* GCC 5.4.0
